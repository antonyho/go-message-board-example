**This is not completed. Please do not evaluate this project as it is completed.**

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Assumptions
- This project is assumed to be built under BASH environment.
- The public API part has no authentication and no rate controller. Therefore, it is vulnerable to DDoS attack and any kind of overflow attack.
- The user authentication and ACL security part is weak. Basically, at least JWT should be applied. This is a little bit big for a coding challenge demo, but can be a stretch goal.
- JWT shall never be used on HTTP protocol without encryption. Otherwise, the plaintext JWT will be exposed and will be used for reply attack. But this demo is not going to have a SSL certificate.
- This project can be splitted into several microservices. However, to keep it as a small coding challenge demo again.
- Data Loader, and Authentication Service could both be standalone microservices. 

### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
make run
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
make image
```

Once image is built use
```
docker run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 antonyho-messageboard-api-example
```
